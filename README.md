# SpaceShooter
Scratch space shooter game

## Description
Made from *Learn to Code with Scratch* for teaching kids to code

## Playing the Game
Your spaceship has lost engine power in the asteroid field and you must avoid being hit by the lava balls and other spacecraft.

Use the arrows to change your thrusters and the spacebar to fire your lasers. Because your ship has lost engine power, you may only fire your lasers once per second. You start off with 3 shields.
